## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- wow.min.js library
- animate.min.js library

### What I learned

During the process my partner decided that we should use SCSS as it's more comfortable to construct web-pages, so I learned some basic information and syntax of SCSS. When it comes to JS, we learned how to use wow.min.js and animate.min.js libraries. Not only that, but we also learned new stuff about DOM and parsel bundler. 
It was also our first experience of teamwork in GitHub, where we both contributed some new things to our code.
We learnod how to use deploy, make push and pull request to the repository from a different account. 
We also learned about syntax of readme.md files for this kinid of projects.

### Continued development

We want to focus more on learning new things related to javascript, improve our frontend skills. 
It's nice when you can use JavaScript so that your web-page looks alive, with animations and other scripts.
We want to keep progressing as teamplayers in a group project as it is crucial for a web-developer.
